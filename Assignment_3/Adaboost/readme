##### Why preprocessing ?

* The data provided in the moodle was not being read properly by the c++ getline function. So, I had to preprocess them. I read the lines, stripped them and wrote them back. 

##### Requriements
1. Python 3
2. C++ 14

### To Build
```
$ make preprocess
$ make a.out
```

### To Run

```
$ make run
```

### To Clean

```
$ make clean
```
